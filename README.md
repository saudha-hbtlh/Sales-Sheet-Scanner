# Sales-Sheet-Scanner
## SUMMARY

The Sales Sheet Scanner is a Flask web application designed to help users determine whether a product is good for selling or not based on provided sales data. Simply upload a preprocessed CSV file containing sales data, and the app will analyze it to provide insights.

## üìö Dependencies
To auto-install the dependencies for this project in a subshell virtual environment, the only packages you'll have to have pre-installed are `python`,'flask','flask_cors', 'pandas','transformers','re'


## üíª How to Locally Run this Repo
1. Download repo to local machine and `cd` into directory
2. pip install the above dependencies
4. Run `python check.py` to serve the web-app and host it on a local server on your machine ‚Äî you'll probably get some warnings about unpickle-ing the machine learning estimator pipeline, but please disregard & open the server @ http://127.0.0.3:5002/ (instead of 8050, your computer might run it on a different port number.. if it happens make sure to change the port number in js)

### 0Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî DATA REFINING & CLEANING

I collected information from an Etsy website by webscrapping. Then, I looked at the data closely using a program called Jupyter Notebook. I made sure the data was neat and accurate by fixing any mistakes or missing pieces.I made sure the missing pieces fit perfectly by creating a linear model to calculate the accuracy..

After that, I used another program called Pandas to organize and clean up the data, making it easier to work with. I also used NumPy to do some math stuff to make the data even better for analysis.

Finally, I used a tool called Matplotlib to turn the data into pictures that are easy to understand. These pictures helped me see patterns and important details in the data.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî PREDICTIVE MODELING

I used a fancy tool called RoBERTa to understand how people feel in text, like whether they're happy, sad, or angry. I taught RoBERTa about emotions using lots of examples in a program called Jupyter Notebook.

Once RoBERTa learned what to look for, I gave it some text to see how well it could guess people's feelings. I tried different sentences to see if RoBERTa could figure out if they were positive, negative, or neutral.

After making sure RoBERTa worked well in Jupyter Notebook, I decided to use it in a web app made with Flask. This way, people could type in text, and RoBERTa could tell them how the words made people feel.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Web App


I developed a Flask application with four main components to handle various aspects of data processing and analysis. 

The application verifies the suitability of the provided data by ensuring it contains essential columns such as reviews, item ratings, and shipping ratings. 

Once confirmed, the app proceeds to preprocess the data, correcting any errors and preparing it for analysis. 

Subsequently, the application employs sentiment analysis techniques to gauge the sentiment expressed in customer reviews, determining whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. 

Finally, leveraging the processed data and sentiment analysis results, the app calculates the overall Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) value, providing insights into customers' satisfaction levels with the products or services. 

Through these four key components, the Flask app facilitates comprehensive data handling and analysis, empowering users to gain valuable insights into customer sentiments and satisfaction.


### üìä ‚Äî CSI Value Calculation

Importance Scores:
The importance_scores dictionary assigns weights to different aspects of customer satisfaction. In this case, the importance scores are assigned to 'ItemRating', 'ShippingRating', and 'roberta_compound', with values of 0.4, 0.2, and 0.4 respectively. These scores represent the relative importance of each aspect in determining overall customer satisfaction.

Weighted Satisfaction Scores:
The weighted_satisfaction_scores dictionary is calculated by multiplying the satisfaction scores for each aspect by their respective importance scores. This results in a weighted satisfaction score for each aspect. For example, if the satisfaction score for 'ItemRating' is 0.8 and its importance score is 0.4, the weighted satisfaction score for 'ItemRating' would be 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32.

Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI):
The CSI is calculated by taking the sum of the weighted satisfaction scores and dividing it by the sum of the importance scores. This normalization step ensures that the CSI remains within the range of 0 to 1, where 0 represents the lowest level of satisfaction and 1 represents the highest level of satisfaction.

Normalization:
After calculating the CSI, it is then normalized to ensure it falls within the range of 0 to 1. This is achieved by using the max and min functions to clamp the CSI value within the specified range.

Printing CSI Value:
Finally, the calculated CSI value is printed to the console for display or further processing.

In summary, the CSI is a weighted average of satisfaction scores for different aspects, where the weights are determined by the importance of each aspect. This allows businesses to assess overall customer satisfaction in a structured and quantitative manner.
